# The Vanilla Web Project

This project is a follow-up to my completion of the JavaScript30 Challenge.

While completing that challenge, I decided to put up a web page with my
completed results. I then had the idea that I should have a project to showcase
things I learned from doing the JavaScript30, but I wanted it to be my original
work, and also to contain more real world things, as I thought the JavaScript30
projects, while cool, were sometimes a bit artificial.

This is the result. The pieces of the Vanilla Web Project were all inspired by
Wes Bosâ€™s original JavaScript30 projects, with my own creativity thrown in.
